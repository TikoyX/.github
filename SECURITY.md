# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Hey there! If you're checking out this security policy, you probably care about keeping things safe. Nice!

Since this is mostly a personal project space, I don’t have strict versioning rules, but here’s a general idea:

| Version | Supported?         |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ✅ Yep!             |
| Older   | ❌ Probably not 😅   |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Found a security issue? Yikes! Here’s what to do:

1. **Don’t panic!**
2. **Please don’t post it publicly**—send me a heads-up first.
3. Drop me an email at **security@theodor.dk** or open an issue (if it’s not super sensitive).
4. Give me details like:
   - What’s broken?
   - How bad is it?
   - How did you find it?
   - Any ideas for fixing it?
5. I’ll try to get back to you within **a couple of days** and sort things out.

## Security Updates

I do my best to keep things up to date, but this is a personal project, so no guarantees. If you notice something outdated, feel free to nudge me!

## Responsible Disclosure

I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to report issues responsibly. Please:
- Give me **some time** to fix things before going public.
- Be **cool**—don’t use any vulnerabilities for bad stuff.
- Follow common sense and applicable laws.

Thanks for looking out! 🚀
